# Internal representations of neural networks
Analysis of internal representations of deep neural networks

### Usage
Clone the repository and install requirements as specified in `requirements.txt`.

##### Simple example
Simple example of training a network and showing heatmaps can be accessed two ways:
- using jupyter notebook
- calling `python src/simple.py` and following instructions in console

The network sometimes converges to a suboptimal solution, rerunning the training procedure (as well as initialization of network) might be needed to reach optimum.
